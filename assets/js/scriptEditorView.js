/**
 * Script Editor View
 *
 * Note: The Script Editor is now initialized directly from app.js
 * after the view HTML is loaded, to ensure DOM elements exist.
 *
 * All initialization, context menu registration, and event handling
 * is now done in scriptEditor.js (init() method) for better organization.
 *
 * This file is kept for potential future view-specific logic.
 */

// No initialization needed here - everything is handled in scriptEditor.js
